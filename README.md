# Language and the Brain

This is a repository of final projects from SLH/LIN350 - "Language and the Brain", taught by Prof. Liberty Hamilton at the University of Texas at Austin. The purpose of these projects is to create article or a short video presentation in the style of articles from <b><i>Frontiers for Young Minds</i></b>, an open access publication that is written for and reviewed by kids. These articles and videos are meant to explain a core concept related to language and the brain to a wide audience, without the amount of jargon that would be expected from a typical scientific article.
